name: revalidate
description: Re-run the checker against an already-built deliverable without rebuilding it — judge an existing artifact, item, or pull request and report the verdict. Use when review feedback needs re-checking, after a hand-edit or a fixup commit, when CI flags a fidelity regression, when a PR's measurements look stale because main moved under it, or whenever someone asks to re-check / re-validate / re-verify a component or a PR rather than build a new one.

# revalidate — judge again, without building again

`/outsystems-loop:revalidate <item-id | PR number | artifact path>`

Runs **`@outsystems-loop:checker`** against an artifact that already exists and reports the
verdict. **It never invokes the maker and never edits source.**

## Why this exists

The checker used to have exactly one caller: `per-item-build.md`, inside the loop, at build time.
So the only way to re-answer a question about existing code was to rebuild it — paying for a full
maker pass to re-judge something nobody wanted changed. Worse, a rebuild *can* change the artifact,
which means you no longer know whether the verdict moved because the judgment differed or because
the code did.

Re-judging and re-building are different questions. This answers the first one only.

## When to reach for it

| Situation | Why not a rebuild |
|---|---|
| Review feedback that is a **question**, not a change ("is this contrast really fine?") | nothing needs building |
| A hand-edit or fixup commit on the branch | the build-time verdict no longer describes the code |
| CI flagged a fidelity regression | you want the judgment, not just the arithmetic |
| `main` moved under an open PR | re-measure against what would actually merge |
| A verdict looks wrong | re-judging a rebuilt artifact confounds two variables |

For an actual **change** to the artifact, do not use this — put the feedback on the PR, set the
item back to `queued`, and let the loop rebuild.

## Procedure

### 1. Resolve the target to an item and a ref

Accept any of: an item id (`cmp-button`), a PR number (`33`), or an artifact path
(`src/blocks/uswds-button.css`). Resolve to the item in `loop/state.json` and its frozen ref at
`loop/refs/<id>/`.

For a PR number: `gh pr view <n> --json headRefName,files,body` — the item id is in the title/body
the loop wrote, and `git switch` to its head before judging. **Judge the code that is actually on
the branch**, not whatever is in the working tree.

> **No ref ⇒ BLOCKED. Stop.** Never substitute the artifact's own prose, a screenshot, or live
> Figma. Without the frozen ref the checker grades the maker against the maker's own output, which
> is the one failure the whole ref mechanism exists to prevent. Say which item, say the ref is
> missing, and stop — do not improvise a spec.

Check ref staleness too: if the ref's recorded Figma **file key** differs from
`project.config.json → figma.fileKey`, the ref is stale (`needs-re-ref`), not spec. Libraries get
forked and silently re-versioned. Report it and stop; re-freezing needs Figma, which is the
orchestrator's job, not this skill's.

### 2. Make sure the harness is sound before judging

A gate that cannot measure returns `unverified`, and `unverified` caps at FAIL — so a broken
harness looks exactly like a broken component. Rule it out first:

```bash
npm run build:theme          # check:config → assemble → validate:theme
git submodule status         # a leading `-` means vendor/outsystems-ui is not checked out
```

If `vendor/outsystems-ui/` is missing, `git submodule update --init && npm run build:osui` **before**
judging. Otherwise the preview 404s where the framework should be, the cascade silently falls back,
and every measurement describes a page nobody will ever see.

### 3. Delegate to the checker

Hand it the item, its ref, and the artifact. It runs its own deterministic gate, authors or reuses
`loop/refs/<id>/probes.json`, runs `measure-fidelity.mjs`, applies risk-tiered depth, and
adversarially challenges every finding before confirming it.

It returns VERDICT, RISK-TIER, DET-GATE, VISUAL, MEASUREMENTS, CONFIDENCE, CRITIQUE,
FINDINGS-CONFIRMED, FINDINGS-CHALLENGED-OUT, DECISION-LOG — the same contract as in the loop, so
the output is comparable with the verdict already in the PR.

### 4. Report, and route findings the same way the loop does

- **PASS** — say so, and note anything that changed since the PR's recorded verdict. If the item
  was `needs-human`, it may now move to `ready_for_review`; record `visual`, `det_gate`,
  `confidence` and the new `decision_log` on the item in `loop/state.json`.
- **FAIL (drift)** — the build no longer matches the ref. **Drift is never a finding**: it goes
  back to the maker. Report the MEASUREMENTS table and say the item needs a rebuild.
- **FAIL (subjective)** — report the CRITIQUE. Do not fix it here.
- **BLOCKED** — missing or stale ref, per step 1.

**Findings** follow the loop's rules exactly: confirmed ones are deduped by `[node:<id>]` and filed
as Bugs; challenged-out ones go to `findings/findings-register.md` as `not-reproduced` with the
usage evidence, and never become bugs. Never re-file anything in
`knownFalsePositiveClasses`, and never raise a finding against a convention whose status is not
`confirmed`.

### 5. Optionally post it to the PR

When the target was a PR and the user wants it recorded, add a comment — the fresh verdict, the
MEASUREMENTS table, and **the commit sha it was judged at**, because a verdict with no sha is the
same stale-snapshot problem this skill exists to fix.

Ask before posting. A PR comment is visible to everyone on the repo.

## Rules

1. **Never invoke the maker.** If the artifact needs changing, say so and stop.
2. **Never edit source, tokens, handovers or the register** — the checker's own constraint. Only
   the gate's scratch artifacts under `loop/refs/<id>/` may be written.
3. **Never judge without a ref.** BLOCKED is a real, correct outcome.
4. **Never merge, approve, or move an item to a human-owned state.** A re-check is evidence for a
   human, not a substitute for one.
5. **Never report a verdict without saying which commit it was judged at.**
6. **Never relax the gate to get a green.** `unverified` from a broken harness is fixed by fixing
   the harness.
