description: Write BEM-compliant CSS for OutSystems Reactive Web and ODC components that consumes design tokens from :root, follows the user's stored prefixing conventions, and is upgrade-safe against OutSystems UI updates. Use this skill whenever the user needs to write CSS for an OutSystems component, customize an OutSystems UI pattern, add a CSS class to a Block or Theme, override styles via ExtendedClass, or asks for BEM in any OutSystems context.

# OutSystems BEM CSS Generator

Generate production-grade BEM CSS for OutSystems Reactive Web and ODC.

## Pre-flight

1. Check `memory_user_edits` for "OutSystems convention:" entries. If missing → invoke `outsystems-onboarding` first.
2. Use the stored prefix (e.g., `acme-`) throughout. Never ask "what prefix?" — it's in memory.
3. **Read upstream before writing a selector.** This skill owns BEM naming and nothing else. Where
   the CSS belongs, which variables exist, and which utility classes already cover the property are
   all platform knowledge, read from the pinned upstream pack:

   | Need | Read |
   | --- | --- |
   | Where this CSS belongs (Theme / Screen / Block, and why Theme is the default) | `vendor/outsystems-frontend-skills/common/css-customization.md` |
   | The `:root` variables, utility classes, colour palette, spacing scale | `vendor/outsystems-frontend-skills/ui-frameworks/outsystems-ui/styles-and-utilities.md` |
   | Breakpoints and responsive behaviour | `vendor/outsystems-frontend-skills/common/responsive-design.md` |
   | Whether the framework already ships this widget | `vendor/outsystems-frontend-skills/ui-frameworks/outsystems-ui/blocks-index.md` |

   Do not restate their contents here or infer them from memory. If the submodule is missing, stop
   and say so — guessing a variable name produces a rule that silently never applies.

## When to use

- User shares a component spec or screenshot and asks for CSS
- User asks to customize an OutSystems UI pattern (Card, Button, Tabs, Accordion, etc.)
- User asks to write styles for a custom Block
- User mentions `ExtendedClass`, Theme CSS, Block CSS, or Screen CSS
- User shares Figma component details and wants the OutSystems implementation
- User asks "how do I override [pattern name]?"

## When NOT to use

- Component doesn't exist in OutSystems UI → use `outsystems-web-component` skill instead (L5)
- User wants just a token update → use `outsystems-token-extractor` skill

## Rule minus-one: a utility class beats a rule you wrote

Before rule zero, before BEM, before any selector at all: check whether OutSystems UI already ships
a utility class for the property. The catalog is upstream in `styles-and-utilities.md` — spacing,
colour, typography, layout, flex, position, display, border-radius and shadow are all covered.

A custom rule is justified only when (a) the property has no utility equivalent (gradient,
animation, clip-path, transform), or (b) the value falls outside the utility scale. Even then the
rule body stays minimal — every property a utility can express goes on `ExtendedClass` beside your
class name, not into your class body.

The failure this prevents: a seven-property class where five of the properties are
`display-flex align-items-center justify-content-center border-radius-circle` under different names,
now maintained by you instead of by the framework.

## Rule zero: restyle, don't shadow

**Before you write one BEM class, find out whether OutSystems UI already names this thing. If it
does, you restyle THAT name.** BEM is how you name what the framework has *no* name for — it is
not a parallel vocabulary to run beside the framework's.

Grep the framework's own SCSS (`vendor/outsystems-ui/src/scss/`) and the project's captured
rendered HTML (`outsystems-widgets-reference/`) for the widget **and every variant of it**. Then:

| What you found | Write this | Never this |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Framework has the widget class | `.btn { … }` — the **bare** class | `.acme-button.btn { … }` |
| Framework has the variant class | `.btn-primary`, `.btn-large`, `.btn-success` | `.acme-button--primary`, `--big` |
| Framework has the token | redefine `--color-primary`, `--space-m` in the theme | mint `--acme-color-primary` beside it |
| Framework has **no** equivalent | `.acme-<block>--<variant>` + `ExtendedClass` | — |
| Widget doesn't exist at all | → `outsystems-web-component` (L5) | — |

**Why the second column is not "safer".** `.acme-button.btn` reads like careful, scoped hygiene.
It isn't: the platform never emits `.acme-button`, so the rule only fires when a developer types
it into `ExtendedClass` on that one widget. Every button they forget renders framework-grey. A
theme built that way doesn't theme anything — it ships a per-widget opt-in and calls itself a
design system. Restyling the bare class is what makes the brand the default.

**Restyling a bare class disturbs its siblings.** Your rule lands at the same specificity as the
framework's and later in the cascade, so `.btn { height: 38px }` silently overrides
`.btn-small { height: 32px }`. Enumerate the framework's sibling modifiers; map each to a design
variant, or exclude it on purpose (`.btn:not(.btn-small)`). Never leave one to break by accident,
and never invent a size or colour the design doesn't specify just to fill a gap — say the gap
exists.

**Deliver the mapping, not just the CSS.** When you restyle framework classes, the developer's
instruction is "set the widget's **Style** property to Primary", not an `ExtendedClass` string.
Output the mapping table (framework class → design variant) alongside the code.

## Inputs needed

From context or quick inference:
1. **What component?** (name, screenshot if available)
2. **OutSystems UI pattern this extends?** (Card, Button, etc. — or "Custom Block")
3. **CSS location?** (Theme / Block / Screen — decided by `vendor/outsystems-frontend-skills/common/css-customization.md`, not by this skill)
4. **States needed?** (hover, focus, disabled, active, error, loading…)

If anything is unclear, make a reasonable assumption and state it. Don't pause for clarification on every detail.

## BEM rules

```
.{prefix}-{block}                            /* Block */
.{prefix}-{block}__{element}                 /* Element */
.{prefix}-{block}--{modifier}                /* Modifier */
.{prefix}-{block}__{element}--{state}        /* Element state */
```

### Forbidden (refuse to generate)

```css
.acme-card.is-open { }                      /* coupling */
.acme-card[data-state="open"] { }           /* data attribute styling */
.acme-card { color: #1A73E8; padding: 16px; }  /* hard-coded values */
#b1-CardWrapper { }                         /* OutSystems-generated IDs */
.acme-card { color: red !important; }       /* unjustified !important */
.acme-button.btn { }                        /* opt-in gate on a framework class — style .btn */
.acme-button--big { }                       /* duplicates .btn-large — style .btn-large */
```

### Required patterns

```css
.acme-card--is-open { }                     /* state as modifier */
.acme-card { color: var(--color-primary); padding: var(--space-m); }  /* tokens */
.acme-card:hover { }                        /* pseudo-classes OK */
```

## Output format

Two shapes, and rule zero decides which:

- **Restyling a framework widget** (the common case) — selectors are the framework's own bare
  class names. Head the file with the mapping table and deliver "set the widget's Style property
  to X", not an `ExtendedClass` string. See `references/common-patterns.md`.
- **Building something the framework has no name for** — full BEM under the project prefix,
  applied via `ExtendedClass`. That is the shape below.

```css
/* ============================================
   Component: [Name]
   Pattern: [OS UI Pattern this extends, or "Custom Block"]
   Location: [Theme CSS / Block CSS / Screen CSS]
   Escalation Level: L1 / L2 / L3 / L4
   Tokens consumed: [list]
   ============================================ */

/* Block */
.acme-card { /* ... */ }

/* Elements */
.acme-card__header { }
.acme-card__body { }
.acme-card__footer { }

/* Modifiers (variants) */
.acme-card--featured { }
.acme-card--compact { }

/* States */
.acme-card--is-loading { }
.acme-card__header--is-active { }

/* Pseudo-state interactions */
.acme-card:hover { }
.acme-card:focus-visible { }
.acme-card[aria-disabled="true"] { }

/* Responsive (mobile-first) */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .acme-card { /* tablet+ */ }
}
```

Then provide:
1. **How the developer applies it.** For a framework restyle, the widget property that emits the
   class (`Style = Primary` → `.btn-primary`) — plus the mapping table. Only for classes the
   framework has no name for, the **ExtendedClass string**:
   ```
   ExtendedClass = "acme-card acme-card--featured"
   ```
2. **Where to paste this CSS** (Theme / Block / Screen)
3. **Any Block input parameters** that should be added (if building a custom Block)
4. **Which framework siblings you touched**, and which you deliberately left alone.
